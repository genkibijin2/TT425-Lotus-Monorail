# TT425 Lotus Monorail
ZPL Label .prt file to HAFFNER TT425 SAW .csv conversion program
This program functions in lieu of an official driver for Window Designer => TT425 Saw. 
Currently built for the hardware that is appropriate for operation of the saw, so Windows x86_64.
Takes old .prt files that are generated when processing items through other machines in the factory, then converts them from ZPL code to a .csv that can be parsed by the TT425 in order to cut profile in the right places.
